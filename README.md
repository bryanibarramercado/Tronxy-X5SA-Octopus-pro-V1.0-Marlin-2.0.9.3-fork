# Tronxy-X5SA-Octopus-pro-V1.0-Marlin-2.0.9.3-fork
The files that I have used in order to get my Tronxy X5SA 3D printers to work with the octopus pro V1.0 board. Also will have schematics, CAD files and any other modifications that I made. This is for documenting purposes as I couldn't find any others.
